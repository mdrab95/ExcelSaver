# excelsaver
This program selects every Excel Process (from list of Processes) and checks if there are opened workbooks. If yes, it saves every Excel document as a new file (path: C:\ExcelSaver; if in opened app is a cell in edit mode, ExcelSaver will end it first. To do this, my program moves Excel window foreground and simulates 'enter' keypress). Then ExcelSaver closes Excel app, cleans memory and reopens all saved documents.
